Analysis of the role of biosensors in the food industry in India and developed economies and subsequently compared the food safety standards. Determined the non-tariff-based barriers prevalent between the developing and the developed economies. Constructed a panel data regression model which quantified the loss of export value due to these non-tariff-based barriers.
